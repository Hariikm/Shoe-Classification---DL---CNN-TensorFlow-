# Shoe-Classification--DL--CNN-TensorFlow-
 "Imagine having a shoe store. Easily identify customer's favored shoe styles. Showcase new releases and complementary products tailored to them. Meet my new algorithm: fueled by TensorFlow, it sorts shoes as Boots, Sandals, or Slippers. Enhance the customer journey!"

<h3> What's the project all about? </h3>

ðŸ”¸ Our primary objective is to classify shoe types into Boots, Slippers, and Sandles. <br>

ðŸ”¸ For that, we used robust CNN algorithm from TensorFlow to create our model. We used a dataset ( folder ) containing images &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of boots, sandals and slippers for the model to train from. We did everything in Google Collab as the computational power is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; limited for me.

ðŸ”¸ We only got train and test files, and with that, we also created a validation file to validate our results.

ðŸ”¸ After this we trained the model and created a function called predict to predict the shoe type with its index number of it and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also a function called show to show the real image of the same
